#  Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to this educational repository where you'll find simple implementations of core machine learning algorithms coded **from scratch using only Python and NumPy** â€” no external ML libraries like scikit-learn!

This project is aimed at **beginners** who want to understand the math and logic behind popular ML models.

## Algorithms Implemented

Each `.py` file contains an independent implementation:

| Algorithm              | Description                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**  | Predict continuous values                  |
| **Logistic Regression**| Classify binary outcomes                   |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors**| Classify data using distance-based voting  |

## Environment Setup

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### 2. Run in Your Favorite IDE

You can use:
- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## How to Run the Code

Simply run each script individually:

```bash
python linear_regression.py
python logistic_regression.py
python knn.py
```

Each script includes:
- A small dataset (or synthetic data)
- Step-by-step model training
- Final prediction
- Accuracy or evaluation metrics
