#  Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to this educational repository where you'll find simple implementations of core machine learning algorithms coded **from scratch using only Python and NumPy** â€” no external ML libraries like scikit-learn!

This project is aimed at **beginners** who want to understand the math and logic behind popular ML models.

## Algorithms Implemented

Each `.py` file contains an independent implementation:

| Algorithm              | Description                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**  | Predict continuous values                  |
| **Logistic Regression**| Classify binary outcomes                   |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors**| Classify data using distance-based voting  |
